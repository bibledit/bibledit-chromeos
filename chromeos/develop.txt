Bibledit as a native Chrome app or extension.

There is a Chrome "extension" and a Chrome "app". They are different.

A Chrome extension runs within the Chrome browser. A Chrome app runs on Chrome OS outside of the Chrome browser.

A Chrome extension or app can access the network through defined and limited APIs. See https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_network. The Pepper API gives access to the network and other resources. Some Pepper features, such as TCP or UDP socket access, are only allowed in Chrome apps. See https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/sdk/examples. Bibledit uses TCP sockets. Therefore Bibledit cannot run as a Chrome "extension", only as a Chrome "app".

Google supports Android apps on Chrome OS. This is a quick and easy way to get Bibledit to Chrome OS. It will behave as a Chrome app. It is therefore not worth the effort to create a "native" Bibledit app for Chrome OS.
