Bibledit as a native Chrome app or extension.

There is a Chrome "extension" and a Chrome "app". They are different.

A Chrome extension runs within the Chrome browser. A Chrome app runs on Chrome OS outside of the Chrome browser.

A Chrome extension or app can access the network through defined and limited APIs. See https://developer.chrome.com/apps/app_network. The Pepper API gives access to the network and other resources. Some Pepper features, such as TCP or UDP socket access, are only allowed in Chrome apps. See https://developer.chrome.com/native-client/sdk/examples. Bibledit uses TCP sockets. Therefore Bibledit cannot run as a Chrome "extension", only as a Chrome "app".

Google supports Android apps on Chrome OS. This is a quick and easy way to get Bibledit to Chrome OS. It will behave as a Chrome app. It is therefore not worth the effort to create a "native" Bibledit app for Chrome OS.

A future improvement could be to maintain only one Android app, that runs on Android and Chrome OS. Currently there's two different Bibledit apps, one for Android, one for Chrome OS. OS feature detection could then detect which platform it runs on. The app could then adapt itself to the platform it runs on. More information is here:
